# Thermal Imaging Project

In this research work, We have developed a deep learning framework for real-time user interface detection and obfuscation from the thermal camera feed. We have adopted two state-of-the-art models, namely Faster R-CNN and YOLO. The corresponding codes are available in the respective folders.
